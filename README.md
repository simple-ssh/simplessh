# SimpleSSH

**SSH File Manager** — an easy way to manage your VPS/VDS via SSH with a user-friendly interface on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## About

SimpleSSH is a Java-based application that does **not** require installation on your VPS. It performs the same tasks you would do via command line using PuTTY or Terminal. For example, when you open the file manager to view folders and files, SimpleSSH sends the command:

```bash
sudo ls /var/www/
````

to your VPS via SSH.

The advantage of using SimpleSSH is that you don’t need to memorize all the commands, and it doesn’t consume RAM or disk space on your VPS — which is especially important if your VPS has only 1GB of RAM.
