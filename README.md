## About

SimpleSSH is a Java-based application that does **not** require installation on your VPS. It performs the same tasks you would do via command line using PuTTY or Terminal. For example, when you open the file manager to view folders and files, SimpleSSH sends the command:

```bash
sudo ls /var/www/
````

to your VPS via SSH.

The advantage of using SimpleSSH is that you don‚Äôt need to memorize all the commands, and it doesn‚Äôt consume RAM or disk space on your VPS ‚Äî which is especially important if your VPS has only 1GB of RAM.

Perfect ‚Äî here's a polished version of the **Project Structure & Build Instructions** section formatted specifically for your `README.md` on GitHub:

 
## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure & Build Instructions

### üìÅ Folder Structure

- `front2/` ‚Äì React-based frontend application
- `src/` ‚Äì Spring Boot backend (requires Java 21)

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- **Java 21**
- **Node.js** (for building the React frontend)
- **Maven** (for building and running the Spring Boot backend)

### üì¶ Build Instructions

1. **Build the Frontend**

   Navigate to the `front2/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd front2
   npm install
   npm run build
````
This will generate a production-ready `build/` folder inside `front2/`.


2. **Copy Frontend Build to Spring Boot**

   Copy the contents of the `build/` folder into the backend's `resources/templates/` directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r front2/build/* src/main/resources/templates/
   ```
 
3. **Run the Spring Boot Application**

   From the project root:

   * If using **Maven**:

     ```bash
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```
